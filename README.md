Tierpsy Tracker is a multi-animal tracker from the [MRC-LMS](http://lms.mrc.ac.uk/) [Behavioural Genomics Group](http://behave.csc.mrc.ac.uk/) at Imperial College London, primarily developed for analyzing *Caenorhabditis elegans* behavioural data [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0112-1), [2](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2017.0375)]. The project combines the throughput of multiworm tracking with the resolution of single worm tracking, which means you can extract detailed phenotypic fingerprints from more animals.  A large field of view also makes it possible to analyse collective behaviours that depend on animal interactions.  The code is open source and extensible and we have ongoing projects using the tracker to analyse fish, *Drosophila* larvae, and worms.
